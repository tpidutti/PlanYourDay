# PlanYourDay

This is a day planner for an eight hour work day.  It designates the current hour, as well as the past and future hours with color blocks.  It provides space to type in events, then stores the text when the save button is clicked.  The information is visible in the appropriate time block after the page is refreshed, but can be removed if deleted and the empty block resaved.
